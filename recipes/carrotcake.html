        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Delight friends with an afternoon tea that includes this easy carrot cake. You can bake the cake, freeze it and just drizzle over the icing on the day</p>
        <p>Carrot cakes are really nice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>175g light muscovado sugar</li>
            <li>175ml sunflower oil</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>140g grated carrot</li>
            <li>100g raisins</li>
            <li>1 large orange, zested</li>
            <li>175g self raising flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp grated nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For the frosting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>175g icing sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp orange juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of an 18cm square cake tin with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Tip the sugar, sunflower oil and eggs into a big mixing bowl. Lightly mix with a wooden spoon. Stir in the carrots, raisins and orange zest.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and nutmeg into the bowl. Mix everything together, the mixture will be soft and almost runny.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 40-45 mins or until it feels firm and springy when you press it in the centre.</li>
            <li>Cool in the tin for 5 mins, then turn it out, peel off the paper and cool on a wire rack. (You can freeze the cake at this point if you want to serve it at a later date.)</li>
            <li>Beat the icing sugar and orange juice in a small bowl until smooth â€“ you want the icing about as runny as single cream. Put the cake on a serving plate and boldly drizzle the icing back and forth in diagonal lines over the top, letting it drip down the sides.</li>
        </ol>
